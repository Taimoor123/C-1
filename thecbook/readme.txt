The C Book Exercises

Chapter 1
	-- exercise 1.1
		-- Type in and test Example 1.1 on your system.
	-- exercise 1.2
		 -- Using Example 1.2 as a pattern, write a program that prints prime pairs
 			- a pair of prime numbers that differ by 2, for example 11 and 13, 29 and 31.
 	-- exercise 1.3
 		--  Write a function that returns an integer: the decimal value of a string of 
 			digits that it reads using getchar. For example, if it reads 1 followed by 
 			4 followed by 6, it will return the number 146.
 	-- exercise 1.4
 		-- Use the function that you just wrote to read a sequence of numbers. Put them 
 			into an array declared in main, by repeatedly calling the function. Sort them
 			into ascending numerical order, then print the sorted list.
 	-- exercise 1.5
 		Again using the function from Exercise 1.3, write a program that will read numbers
 		from its input, then print them out in binary, decimal and hexadecimal form.
